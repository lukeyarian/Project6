# Project 6: Notes App

This application is meant to let the user take notes and save them.

## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

*Code is mostly implemented, but riddled with errors that come one after another (no way to test)

## Video Walkthrough

*Unable to provide video walkthrough, app does not run properly.

## Notes

This app development process went a little bit better than last week, but I ended up with an app that didn't completely compile, and as I tried to debug, more and more errors just kept popping up until midnight. I will work more on it tomorrow when I have more time.
It should be mostly complete by this point maybe only missing a little bit (not entirely sure as I haven't been able to run the app for a while).

My app file is not committing or pushing but everything else is???
