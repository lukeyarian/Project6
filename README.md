## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:


Uses Firebase realtime database correctly

Correct layout for RecyclerView
Uses Firebase authentication 
UserScreen is implemented correctly 
Implements addValueEventListener to update the RecyclerView 
Menu items and listeners 
Shows Dialog to confirm 
Initial prompt to login/signup 
Application does not crash
Appropriate comments
*Code is mostly implemented, but riddled with errors that come one after another (no way to test)

## Video Walkthrough

*Unable to provide video walkthrough, app does not run properly.

## Notes

This app was difficult because I never had the original Notes app properly working in the first place. Adding code on top of an already broken app was very difficult as I tried to do as much as the assignment asked without much way to test
whether or not what I was doing was right. Overall, I did the best I could to follow the instructions provided in the PDF and from what we learned in class about the new aspects of the app.
